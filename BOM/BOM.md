# BOM

There are two versions of the module, depending on some of the component values mainly.
Details are described in the repository's ReadMe file.

The component values to be selected depending on the module version are given in the corresponding columns for Version A or B of the BOM table below.
If a value is given in column "Value", then the component is version-independent.
